I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Yonsei University ([MVP-Lab](http://mvp.yonsei.ac.kr/)), specializing in computer vision. I am supported by LG Electronics' research scholarship.

I am interested in proposing task-specific, innovative methodologies with the ultimate goal of building reliable machine-learning systems.

My expertise spans: 
- Image/Video Person Re-Identification 
- Video Temporal Grounding
- 2D Image-3D Shape Retrieval
- Self-supervised Learning
- Multimodal Learning
